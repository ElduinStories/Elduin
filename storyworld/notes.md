Notes to be incorporated into other areas later

Most Elves do not have last names and are instead reference by the group they belong to. Only elves of high standing are granted last names

In First age Elves have modest average lifespan of 200 years this goes to 1000 by the end. This is a pretty primative period ending with what is essentially the agricultural revolution
In Second age elves no longer die due to natural causes but most choose to die after 4000 years those that continue to live do so in a state significantly detached from the rest of society and care not for day to day events. This period is noted by the settling of houses.
The Third age shows the development of the first towns The advent of magic usage occurs around this time
The Fourth age has cities, magic development hits its stride.
The Fifth age is that of the city state -> nation state phase. At the end of this period Aleris is split into a few powerful nations
The Sixth age sees the rise of the Grand council of Aleris and the Golden age of the elves
The Seventh age sees the destruction of Aleris

Average elvish lifespan 4000 years

Universal Time System:
Its about time I came up with a universal time which can then be translated appropriately?

0 - Breaking of the universe
1000 - Fracturing of the first plane
105000 - Start of the first age of the elves shorter lives rarely living to 100 ends with agricultural revolution and settling of "houses"
110000 - Second Age Starts with settling of "houses" ends with formation of great houses for protection from others. lifespan increases to 400 if not killed in battle.
116000 - Third age begins Lesser houses become allied with the great houses forming a city state like structure. Discovery of magic around this time, Trade between these states begins. 
117000 - Fourth age AKA the age of magic. Technological progress has stalled but magic has hit its stride. This Age sees the rise of many schools of magic. Lifespans begin rising as magic extends life. Also around this time the city states (which had been at war) start to form elf-nations.
120000 - Fifth age - Empowered by ever more powerful magics the nations make terrible escalating wars with each other.
123000 - Sixth age - Marked by the end of the wars and the formation of the Grand Council (precise nature of this TBD) what follows is an age of peace and study of the world and universe (through portals). Lifespan at this point is immortal as all ailments can be cured though many elves choose to end their lives after 4000 years or leave society
13400 - Seventh "Age" - Historians are torn if this short period from the onset of the rift to the destruction of Aleris counts as an age. Regardless It is the final age before the fleeing to aleris
