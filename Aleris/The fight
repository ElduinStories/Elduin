Start with the fight
Makash opens a rift in aleris, that instead of connecting to a different plane connects to the interplanar space. 
In order to create a stable rift you need to puncture your plane, and the next, and build a bridge between the two. 
Shockwave effect.

Makash was presumably trying to connect to another plane. One of the very chaotic ones, as this would help him create a chaos septstone. Purifying septstones and atuning to a type of energy you can connect to a plane align to the energy you seek in order to expose the stone to that type of energy.
Makash needs to channel a lot of energy so he will require a set up. He would need thousands of channeling stones.  He is in a cave, using the natural crystal formatios of the setting to channel. He needs a focus, and something that connects to the grid, with the crystals working as a capacitor. 
Makash has been gathering energy for months. 

Leylines cannot be a de facto source of magic. Leylines are built, not natural. 

Caves full of crystals used as capacitors to power up portal magic.

Makash ends up getting the chaos-elemental septstone.

Makash as a cultist, possible cult leader? (yuck) / Political agenda... His connections are what allows him to get all the materials in place. 

Nemir is close enough to be impacted by the magical gave, but not to stop the detonation of the magical energy.

Makash/Nemir/Makash/Nemir are we going to have changes in PoV?
Do we have first voice narration or omniscient narrator, or both?
