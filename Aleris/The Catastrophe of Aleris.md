The Tale of Mikash and the Catastrophe of Aleris

This is the tale of the events which led to the destruction of the original home of the elves, Aleris.

The tale, as it is told, begins 300 years before the disaster which fell upon the elven people with the birth of a child named Mikash son of Selldor and Maerion Taval. Selldor the Great, as he was known, was Headmaster of the College of Magic in the capital city of elvish domain Ailron and a master of the rare art of portal magic. Maerion, his mother, was the head of the school of healing. Mikash's birth was met with much anticipation for both parents came from very powerful family lines which could be traced back hundreds of thousands of years. Mikash was expected to be no different.

In his youth Mikash befriended another elf-kid named Nemir Galontaur. Nemir was a bright kid from a more humble family line. His mother was a tender of the gardens (a still somewhat prestigious role) and his Father was an instructor in offensive magic skills (an area of magic which was out of favour during the extended peace the elves had experienced). Never-the-less Mikash and Nemir became fast friends (not that there was a lot of choice) who did most things together often getting into places they shouldn't be (Normally because of Nemir who was somewhat of a rule breaker). When they reached their age coming at  years old they decided (as was allowed) to take the journey with each other as companions. (Elves when they come of age traditionally spend two years travelling through the world, and sometimes through portals to other planes the elves had explored)

During their journey they travelled through the portals to many of the safe lands the elves had found including the fae, home of the faeries. Nemir however quickly grew bored. He suggested that they travel to one of the less safe planes. That of Orcash, and unfriendly marsh-filled land inhabitted by Orcs, who did not care all that much for the Elves. During one of the early encounters between the orcs and the elves, an emmissary had be sent with a priceless jewel septstone as an offering. The Orc-Lord who they had approached murdered the emmissary took the jewel and sent back the emissary's head. This was a tale often told to elf-kids to scare them. Nemir thought it would be a great achievement to try to sneak back into Orcash and steal back the jewel dispite the fact that Orcash was strictly off limits since the treaty which ended the Orc wars 4000 years earlier.

[THIS CAN BE PLAYED]

Mikash did not think this was a good idea but not wanting to appear weak or frightened he went along with Nemir. They snuck across the border without being spotted by the guardians of the border by using travelling cloaks which they stole from Mikash's father and within a day of travelling they had reached the Orcash swamplands. It was well known that at the center of the swamp was a rocky landmass where the Orc-Lord Tregor the Terrible once lived. With each day's travel into the swamp they grew more miserable and tired. On the third day they saw the rock outcropping and a large Orc village. Nemir and Mikash decided to wait until nighttime hiding in a cave on the rock face. It was during this that Mikash finally admitted his hestation of the plan. But Nemir blew it off saying Mikash was just scared. It would be easy, surely such a jewel would be prominantly displayed and would be easy to access.

When night came they snuck into the town. Most of the Orcs were either sleeping or drinking and fighting. They managed to disguise themselves well enough that a drunk Orc would take them as other (rather puny) Orcs. They made it to the largest hut/home which they assumed to be the dwelling of the leader. Contrary to there expectations, when they entered the jewel was not prominantly displayed. Instead it was placed in the hilt of an exquisite elf blade and just so happened to be on the belt of the current leader of the tribe who was busy curousing with about 20 other Orcs.

Nemir and Mikash decided at this point to leave as quickly as possible. Unfortunately they we seen and mistook for some servant Orcs by the party. Nemir took this opportunity to use some of the herbs we brought along (his mother was a gardener and he was well versed in there properties) and slipped some which induced drowsiness into the mead. As the party began to get drowser and the Orc-Lord started to fall asleep Nemir took the opportunity to slip the elf sword from the Orc-Lord's belt and went to collect Mikash who had frozen in fear and hidden behind some mead barrels. After much coaxing Mikash was persuaded to exit his hiding place. Unfortunately just as they were about to leave another group if Orcs stormed into the hut. Nemir and Mikash had apparently choosen a night of an uprising to steal the sword. 

The Orc-Lord who was drugged did not stand a chance and was quickly over-powered as well as most of his companions. With the Orc-lord dead however, all hell broke loose as every orc vied to be the one on top when the fighting ended. Using this chaos as a distraction Nemir and Mikash tried to make their escape however what had just hours before been a quiet night was now an all out brawl. Dodging around the fighting Nemir made it to the outskirts of town only occassionally needing to use some of the rudimentary offensive magic he had learned from his father. However when he reached the edge of town and looked back Mikash was not behind him. Mikash had be struck and injured by a poisoned arrow and was 50 meters behind. nemir showing great bravery shot a handful of fireballs at a few of the surrounding huts as a distraction and ran up to Mikash. Pulling him onto his back Nemir once more made his way out of town and back to the cave they hid in before.

Mikash was badly injured and the poison had already spread quite far. Mikash lost conciousness. Nemir drawing on all his medical knowledge managed to stop the spread of the poison but not before it had done minor damage to Mikash's nervous system leaving him with decreased dexterity. Nemir, knowing that the confusion up top would not last forever and fearing that someone might remember him casting magic decided to begin traversing the swamp and carried Mikash. Six days later he managed to cross back into the elves domain with Mikash. While Nemir had managed to stabilize him, he had not awoken in all that time and the effect of the poison was severe. The Border Guard found Nemir trying to save Mikash and came to aid them. Nemir spun a tale of how they had ventured only a little ways into the swamp in order to see what it is like and had been ambushed by a handful of orcs. Mikash and Nemir were taken back to the capital where Mikash was treated while Nemir faced a tribunal for both of thier actions. Mikash's father being grateful to nemir for saving his son's life and having considerable influence got both boys off with only a severe reprimand.

However things for Mikash were never quite the same. For one he had disappointed his father, a fact that was made clear to him quite frequently. In addition Nemir was cast as Mikash's saviour and this felt like a subserviant position. Even though Nemir never mentioned it and never expressed those same feelings Mikash could sense that everyone looked at Nemir as a hero when infact Mikash had taken the arrow for Nemir (a fact he never told). In addition the lingering effects of the poison compromised his abilities significantly and with their coming of age trip concluded it was time for them to both enter into a domain of training. Both of them entered into the school of magic and went through the placement years.

Placement was a ten year program during which students of the magics would explore the different fields of potential specialization such as

When starting out mikash is the older so takes on more of a protective role of nemir

After the incedent nemir feels responsible for what happened to mikash

And because of the incident puts more effort into his studies

Mikash had natural talent and was use to his expectations (of him) he had an ego, as a result did not put in the effort and starts to fall behind

As this position switches Mikash starts to blame his lack of performance on the injury (Does it actually cause that) and eventualy Nemir.

When Nemir graduates early this """sets mikash off""" at this point he becomes obsessed with proving he can be just as powerful as nemir and starts using objects to augment his abilities.

Most objects are far too weak for his liking and uses his friendship with nemir to gain access to advance texts that mikash would be forbidden to read on his own.

He finds out that a chaos septstone has never been created and he sets his goals to prove himself to be the person who creates it.

In a series of experiments he opens portals to ever more chaotic planes.

One day he goes too far. He is arogant and too confident in his own abilities and makes a flaw during his preparations in the portal opening. As a result he is unable to control the portal. (As it is a highly chaotic plane it would be nearly impossible to control to begin with).

Nemir senses the disturbance in the planar alignment and seeks out its source to find Mikash trying to rectify his mistake. Nemir (having studied portal magic extensively) knows what to do and manages to get the portal under control and seal it.

Nemir is forced to report the incindent to the grand council and at this point feels responsible for not having seen the signs of his friends obsession earlier. Nemir takes responsibilty for providing Mikash with the information before he was mature enough to handle it.

Mikash takes Nemir's pleas for him as just another sign of disrespect and betrayal. Insults to injury.

Mikash's father takes Nemirs pleas into consideration and commutes his sentence from exile to expulsion from the magic academy and a ban to ever perform magic again. Essentially reducing him to a commoner (which is yet another blow to his ego).

In addition the council tasks Nemir with enforcing the magic ban An ever lasting charm is placed on mikash which notifies Nemir that Mikash is performing magic. (As a semi-punishment / lesson)

After the trial Mikash is extremely resentful of Nemir (Mikash refuses to talk to Nemir dispite Nemir being open and friendly and wanting only to maintain the friendship). He also becomes conviced that if he could just get back to the portal and reopen it he would be able to produce the gem and vindicate himself. His obsession only grows suppressing the knowledge that this is extremely dangerous not only for himself but for Aleris itself. His ego comforts him saying that he would have been able to control the portal the first time if Nemir hadn't interfered and done it for him.

Mikash sets out to prepare for the use of the portal again being careful not to use magic in his preparations. (Sneaking around stealing things etc.) 

A few years later consumed by his obsession Mikash makes his move reopening the portal and attempting to produce the septstone of chaos. As he does this he removes safeguard after safeguard in order to better access the chaotic plane confident in his ability to maintain control. He was wrong.

(His end game scenario for this is that even though he will have used magic he will have proved he was infact not too immature before and in his mind he would be forgiven based on the incredible talent he showed)

Mikash manages to produce the Septstone but unable to fix what he had done and unable to admit that he was wrong about his abilities and the fact that nemir and the authorities are almost assurdedly pursuing him, he "quickly" opens a new portal. 

Just as he is about to jump through Nemir shows up. Mikash jumps through and Nemir lets him go.

Nemir's Attention is now focused solely on trying to prevent further spread of the rift to the chaos realm which has now grows significantly. Other Wizards show up to aid in the effort and are able to slow the rifts progress for a time... UNTIL DUN DUN DAAAAAA creatures begin coming through and thus starts the battle for Aleris which end in the fleeing of the elves to Elduin (More details of battle)

[INSERT BATTLE]

(why was the portal to Elduin Created? -> Because the shift in the alignment of Aleris cause the Hall of Portals , portals to become unstable connections. Elduin's Portal was opend both because of Elduins High Order Alignment and as a last resort for evacuation from the war they were slowly losing. Some of the highest magic wielders stayed behind to protect just the hall of portals (a much smaller region so it was feasible) so that the other planes with portals they could not seal due to the instability would be protected from the blight that they failed to defeat.)
