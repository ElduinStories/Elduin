Dwarves - Society and Culture

Despite their Gruff and Surly appearance, Dwarves on a whole are general joyful and good natured race. For the most part they keep to themselves in their underground halls, Though some on occassion have been known to go on travels [particularly around their coming of age?]. Most however take pleasure and pride working within the Earth. They are among the best miners, metalworkers and stone masons anywhere. Their work in these areas can even rival the craftmanship of the elves. In addition to this they are also the most technically advanced of all the races. Their great halls sport all manner of mechanism as well as a wide variety of "automata" as the Dwarves call them. [I'm not sure if i mention here later but most of the "power" for their cities come from hydrothermal whereas their automata and other smaller mechanisms are powered by a rare ore which when heated spins rapidly]

Dwarven Society is organized into "clans" and "houses". A house consists of members who are most closely related to each other (close blood relations), a Clan on the otherhand consists of groups of honour-bound and often closely knit houses. [Only?] on the Island of Vornick do multiple Clans live together. When they spread across Elduin, It became common for a single Clan to occupy a Hall. In general Dwarves are communal, though priority always goes first to ones House, then to ones Clan and finally to its Hall (If different from the Clan). Possibly contrary to this (though the dwarves do not see it that way), they do believe in personal property however its also considered honourable to aid other members of Dwarven society.

The Dwarven people have actually been around for far longer then the elves however, not being great adventurers or sailors they did not arrive to Elduin until part way through the second age by elven reckoning [dwarven dates?]

Although there have been Clan "wars" in the past they amount to little more then annoyances and minor blood feuds when compared to the wars of men. And are normally bloodless as the Dwarves loath to harm one another. This does not mean there are not tensions between the clans and politics. Infact without shedding blood to help decide things quite often the struggle for power and politics is even greater.

Social Order
--------------

Dwarven society is a matriarchal society. Houses are run by females, including the all relations to other houses in the clan. All dwarven politics is conducted by the female dwarves. Unlike the typical in humans, Dwarven women are strong willed and more forceful then dwarven men (and the men like it like that ;) ). Partly due to this and partly because they are far more even tempered then the men, for since before the ages of elves females have ruled society [has it always been like this? if not when/why did it change?]

When a female of a house comes of age (30 years old, the average dwarven lifespan is in the range of 200-250) they enter into formal training, being groomed to take over leadership of the House. Each House has such a leader who may remain Leader for as long as she likes or until she is found to be incapable of carrying on as leader. She then either appoints a successor or a quorum of the of-age females of the house choose a new leader. These leaders (known as [vels]) help guide not only the decisions of a house but also the decisions of the clan to which the house belongs. Each Clan itself also has a leader (a [vel dor]) chosen from the vels to represent the clan's interests in the grand Council of Clans.  [How many clans are there total? 15? 7?]. Each Vel dor gets 5 years during which they are the head of the council. (during this time they have the title of vel dir). While in this position, they make the final decision on any issues which arrive and drive the direction of the entirety of the dwarven people. Due to the nature of rotations these decisions are often swayed by promises to reciprocate at a later date when in power.

Sexuality and Reproduction
------------

Dwarven Sexuality is strange to most other "higher" races in Elduin. Dwarves are born in [litters] of 3-9 at a time. Of them there is typically a 6:1 ratio of males to females. As such having a single female is considered very lucky. Having twin girls is almost unheard of, However when it does occur it is believed to herald great times ahead or great peril. In either case the Twins have always proven to be great leaders.

Due to the extreme unbalance of males to females, Dwarves live in a polyamourous society. They freely engage sexually (more often then not the female will initiate) and is considered a social activity (when the men are not drinking heavily). It is also not uncommon for men to engage with other men though women almost exclusively mate with men. In order to prevent pregnancy dwarven women eat a root (taran root) which acts as a rudimentary but effective birth control method).

The exception to the free form casual relationships are what are known as "matings" which are the closest thing to marriage the Dwarves have. In this process a male from one house is joins another house (commonly in another clan) often to improve ties between the houses or clans. A mating usually results in a litter. Furthermore even a mating is mostly functional, both are free to engage with others and the female is on occassion mated again (this is common for the more powerful houses).

The lives of the males are far more simplistic then those of the females. For them life consists of working in their particular field. This brings them great joy and as such there is no well defined "work schedule" though most follow a three part cycle with long breaks for good meals in between.

Misc?
------------
Dwarves are not great practioners of magic. Before meeting the Elves the Dwarves had no magic to speak of. Instead they relied on their machines and their capablity to harness geothermal power. Even after meeting the Elves only one house (the house of molgru) actively persued it. This is the only house to have ever lived closely with the elves. Between them house molgru merged Dwarven machinery with Elvish magic producing unfathomable contraptions. However they have not been seen since late in the [second? third? age]. Accounts vary but a common story is that there was a loud boom followed by a cloud of dust. After the cloud cleared the entire city which had rested on the top of the mountain had vanished. (The reason is that they had manage to make the city fly using particularly strong magic. This fact is not widely known. Only a handful of the remaining members of house Molgru ever knew the truth)

In addition to their lack of prowness in magic, Dwarves are also not well known as great farmers (surprising since the volcanic soil of the Island of Vornick would make for excellent farm land). As such very little cultivation of the land occured until the Dwarves encountered the cyrilleans (Sea-faring humans). When the cyrilleans set up a port on the Island of Vornick they also brought cultivation of the land and began trade with the dwarves. Before this the dwarves main source of food was a form of algea which grew in ponds along with cultivated fish. When dried and ground this algae had many of the properties of flour (though it did have a slight fishy taste). This was used both in making bread and in the brewing of a mead like drink. After trade with Cyrilleans began this became less common food source, though most good public houses still served its own variety of algae-mead.

Relations with other Races
---------------------------

Elves:
Elves do not particularly understand dwarven culture and actually find them somewhat uncivilized. They do not in general enjoy their company. Dwarves think that Elves are stuck up and humourless and niether side understands the other's sexuality. However despite this, relations between the two races have always [??] been good.

Cyrilleans:
The dwarves maintain trade relations with the cyrilleans

Numen:
The Numen of the North also eventually ended up on good terms with the Dwarves of the Northern Halls. Though during the Elf-Numan wars the Dwarves (when they weren't busy minding their own business) took the Elves side.
