Loose ends

This is a temporary place to keep track of loose ends which might come into play in future stories

Nemir:
Has a Septstone (of fire ultra pure) embedded in the handle of an equisite elven sword. This artifact is kept secret to all.
Is bound to Mikash so that if Mikash ever uses magic in the same plane as Nemir, Nemir will know. This does not work across planes.

Mikash:
Has a Chaos Septstone (Ultra pure)
If uses magic in the same plane as Nemir, Nemir is notified.
Escaped into another plane and the chaos rift followed him. He spends many years trying to avoid this slowly spreading distruction by escaping through to more planes.
