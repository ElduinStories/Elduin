# Elduin
The stories which take place in the universe containing Elduin

This repository contains all materials which are canon in this universe. The master branch is canon. Other branches are not part of cannon until a successful pull request has been made.

#Rules &/| Guidelines
When writing or acting a new adventure or component to Canon follow the following steps:
1) Pull latest Master-branch
2) Create a new branch with a descriptive name and check it out.
3) Make ALL additions | edits until you are satisfied that it is complete and folows the guidelines below for pull-readiness
4) When satisfied push your branch to this repo (if you have push access otherwise go to 5)
5) Make a "pull request" from github to request that the changes be merged into master branch.
6) Wait and or participate in discussion of the whether to merge. Make changes if changes are required.

#Pull-Readiness
When making a pull request the content being pulled should be complete within itself and self contained. If content in one branch depends on content in another branch then those two branches should be merged first and their histories reconciled.

A branch can be incomplete when merged if it ends at a point that has been undecided in canon. Such as the story of how a group of heros got ended up together facing a battle that has not yet been included in the master branch. If the battle were being written however in another branch it is better to merger with that branch instead. your story will be included when the large branch gets pulled.

#Acceptance of a Pull-Request
A Pull request into master can only be accepted with a 2/3rds vote of those members with push access to this repo.

Guidlines for deciding on whether to accept a PR:
1) If the story being PR'ed has been played out in a full game with DM etc. Then this PR should contain all the background materials related to the adventure. Character sheets, maps, layout of enemies etc. The outcome of a DM'ed adventure can not be questioned if this material is provided and the materials are reasonable considering canon.
  -> In theory any suitable ruleset may be used for these adventures. A modified form of the Pathfinder's rules are default and recommended
2) If an adventure was not DM'ed, or was a DM'ed story telling event. Then there are some considerations which should be taken into account.
  a) The prime guideline in these scenarios is that "extraordinary events require extraordinary explaination. For example:
    * If Elves and Men are at war, it makes sense that if an elf or a man met that they would be hostile or wary. If the story contradicts this then it needs to be explained why.
    * Dwarves are not magic weilders in this world but there are exceptions. If an Elf went to magic school then it is not surprising and does not require excessive explanation. But in order for a dwarf to go, there must be a plausible background as to why.
    *Its possible to find a super powerful artifact in a dungeon or even a farm house. But the story of how this artifact came to be must be added. On the other hand is a standard sword is found it can be explained away with much less detail.
  b) Consistancy is a must Canon cannot be contradicted. If an edit to canon is desired the results of that change must be considered throughout and done with much care. It is better to explain an exception then to change history.
  
THere are More I supoose. I'll write it in the organizational repo at some point.

One last note: These rules apply only for merging into master branch other branches are free to follow whatever process they wish.
